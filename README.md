## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Data Source**: OSRS Wiki API (MediaWiki) - parses level up tables
- **Caching**: Local JSON cache in `~/.runelite/level-up-table/`
- **Parser**: Custom wiki markup parser supporting templates and links
- **UI Framework**: Swing with custom modern components

### Key Components
- `WikiClient`: Handles API communication with OSRS Wiki
- `WikiTextParser`: Parses wiki markup and extracts unlock data
- `UnlockRepository`: Manages data storage and caching
- `ModernSkillUnlockPanel`: Main UI with search, filters, and cards

### Performance Optimizations
- Concurrent skill data fetching
- Lazy loading of skill content
- Virtual scrolling for large unlock lists
- Debounced search input
